# {{ .input_root_dir }}

This directory contains an ML project based on the default
[Databricks MLOps Stacks](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stacks),
defining a production-grade ML pipeline for automated retraining and batch inference of an ML model on tabular data.
The "Getting Started" docs can be found at {{ template `generate_doc_link` (map (pair "cloud" .input_cloud) (pair "path" "dev-tools/bundles/mlops-stacks.html")) }}.

See the full pipeline structure below. The [MLOps Stacks README](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stacks/blob/main/Pipeline.md)
contains additional details on how ML pipelines are tested and deployed across each of the dev, staging, prod environments below.

## Using this repo

The table below links to detailed docs explaining how to use this repo for different use cases.

{{ if (eq .input_setup_cicd_and_project `CICD_and_Project`)}}
This project comes with example ML code to train, validate and deploy a regression model to predict NYC taxi fares.
If you're a data scientist just getting started with this repo for a brand new ML project, we recommend 
adapting the provided example code to your ML problem. Then making and 
testing ML code changes on Databricks or your local machine. Follow the instructions from
the [project README](./{{template `project_name_alphanumeric_underscore` .}}/README.md).
{{ end }} 

When you're ready to deploy production training/inference
pipelines, ask your ops team to follow the [MLOps setup guide](docs/mlops-setup.md) to configure CI/CD and deploy 
production ML pipelines.

After that, follow the [ML pull request guide](docs/ml-pull-request.md)
{{ if (eq .input_setup_cicd_and_project `CICD_and_Project`)}} and [ML resource config guide]({{template `project_name_alphanumeric_underscore` .}}/resources/README.md) {{ end }} to propose, test, and deploy changes to production ML code (e.g. update model parameters)
or pipeline resources (e.g. use a larger instance type for model training) via pull request.

## Setting up CI/CD
This stack comes with a workflow to set up CI/CD for projects that can be found in
{{ if (or (eq .input_cicd_platform `github_actions`) (eq .input_cicd_platform `github_actions_for_github_enterprise_servers`)) }}
`.github/workflows/deploy-cicd.yml`.
{{ else if (eq .input_cicd_platform `azure_devops`)}}
`.azure/devops-pipelines/deploy-cicd.yml`.
{{ else if (eq .input_cicd_platform `gitlab`)}}
`.gitlab/cicd.yml`.
{{ end }}

To set up CI/CD for projects that were created through MLOps Stacks with the `Project_Only` parameter, 
run the above mentioned workflow, specifying the `project_name` as a parameter. For example, for the monorepo case:

1. Setup your repository by initializing MLOps Stacks via Databricks CLI with the `CICD_and_Project` or `CICD_Only` parameter.
2. Follow the [MLOps Setup Guide](./docs/mlops-setup.md) to setup authentication and get the repo ready for CI/CD.
3. Create a new project by initializing MLOps Stacks again but this time with the `Project_Only` parameter.
4. Run the `deploy-cicd.yml` workflow with the `project_name` parameter set to the name of the project you want to set up CI/CD for.

{{ if (eq .input_setup_cicd_and_project `CICD_and_Project`)}}
NOTE: This project has already been initialized with an instantiation of the above workflow, so there's no
need to run it again for project `{{.input_project_name}}`.
{{ end -}}
